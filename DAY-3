====>    Class:
•	It’s a blueprint or template that define the properties(variables) and behaviours (methods) of an object.

====>   Object:
•	An instance of a class. It has its own state and behaviour.
 
====>    Constructors:
•	A special method used to initialize objects.
•	Same name as the class and no return type
•	Types: Default, Parameterized, copy constructor
Code:
	Class Student
	{
		String name;
		Student(String n)	// parameterized
		{ name = n;}
	}
		Student s = new Student(“Hello”);

====>    Inheritance:
•	It allows one class to acquire the properties and methods of another class using the extends keyword.
•	Promotes reusability and method overriding.
Code: 
	class Parent {
    void show() { System.out.println("Parent method"); }
}

class Child extends Parent { }

====>    Polymorphism:
•	It means many forms. It is of two types:
1.	Compile-time polymorphism → Method Overloading
2.	Runtime polymorphism → Method Overriding
•	It allows the same method name to behave differently.
Code: 
class Animal {
void sound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
 void sound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
}

====>    Abstraction:
•	Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features.
•	Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
Code: 
abstract class Shape {
   abstract void draw();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing Circle"); }
}

====>    Interfaces
•	An interface is a fully abstract type containing abstract methods (Java 8+ allows default & static methods).
•	A class implements an interface using the implements keyword.
•	Used for abstraction and multiple inheritance support.

•	====>    Encapsulation
•	Encapsulation means wrapping data (variables) and methods into a single unit (class)
•	We make variables private and expose them using getters/setters to protect data.
